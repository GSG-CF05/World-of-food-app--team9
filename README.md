## Problem
People who travel a lot face many problems in choosing food according to the country they are traveling to, and they also face problems in the way of preparing these meals
There are many people who are allergic to some types of food, for this reason when they eat a meal outside the house, it is very important to know the components of this meal.

## Solution
Food World is an application that provides a menu of meals and you can classify meals according to the name of the country.
When you choose a specific meal, it will show you the ingredients of that meal with the method of preparation and an explanatory video of the method of preparation.
